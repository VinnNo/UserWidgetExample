# UserWidgetExample
A custom UUserWidget class, completely contrustcted via C++ and scalable without relying on UDPIScalingRule. Though, I ended up making a custom scaling rule with a DPI scale value of 1 so supress errors in the log.

## 

## Classes
- ### AChildPawnSK
     This is an actor made up of USkeletalMeshComponents. It's basically a stand-in prop to serve some practical purpose for the primary Widget; Swapping Skeletalmeshes on this actor's components which works to the same effect of a character customization screen. The mesh layout could then theoretically be saved and reloaded onto a player pawn or as a child actor of the player pawn at a later stage.
- ### ACharacterEditorPawn
     This is the "player" for the example scene. It spawns the WPawnEditor widget and the AChildPawnSK and manages functionality from the former to the latter. Instead of creating a PlayerController class, this pawn uses the default class and overrides parameters as they relate to UI in the default PlayerController. The idea here was that any PlayerController can be used because the pawn loads after the PlayerController. So, to optout of this pawn's variable overrides, you just simply don't save any changes related to the PlayerController.
- ### WCategoryButton
     Exactly the same as UButton, but extended to pass basic parameters from the OnClicked Delegate. This class is used as child widgets of WPawnEditor for cycling the indices of SkeletalMeshCategories. Simple, sweet, effective!
- ### WPawnEditor
     This is the UUserwidget class that dynamically changes size to fit most sensical screen resoution. This class is the meat and bones of the functionality in this project. It creates the databases (assuming they weren't overriden downwind via Blueprints) used to broadcast relevant delegates to anything that cares for them, in this case, ACharacterEditorPawn.

## TODO / Stretch Goals
- Create a streaming level to generate render target textures at runtime to be used as slate brushes for the UImages that are currenty the white squares
- Finish the zoom functionality
- A save/load system for presets generated by WPawnEditor
- A simple character derrived pawn to make use of those presets
- A slate alternative for widgets like WPawnEditor to derive from

## Extra notes
WELL, I couldn't upload the project in it's entirety because I used Marketplace assests. They were free when I got them (monthly giveaway) but they are not currently and I suspect it would be in bad taste to distribute those.
